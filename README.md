## Business Activities

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
    - As the age of financial technology continues to evolve and experience disruption J.P. Morgan keeps its clients and finance at the forefront of business.  Exchanging value, such as money, between parties over blockchain requires digital currency, so JPM Coin was created allowing the typical settlement time when one client sends money to another over the blockchain instantaneously redeeming the equivalent amount of U.S. dollars.[2]

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
    - Initial customers are institutions passing J.P. Morgan Know Your Customer (KYC) standards process.[2]
    - While the JPM Coin technology is currently only available to a few business instituations of J.P. Morgan during its testing phase in 2019, Umar Farooq is known to have mentioned in 2018 "the cost-savings and efficiency benefits would extend to the end customers of our instituational clients."[3]  This sample size of J.P. Morgan's experiment contains around 27 million accounts[4] allowing for partners of J.P. Morgan and competitors to find the results of the experiment invaluable.
    - Competitive advantages:
        - $2.6 trillion balance sheet, the largest U.S bank
