## Business Activities

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
    - As the age of financial technology continues to evolve and experience disruption, J.P. Morgan keeps its clients and finance at the forefront of business.  Exchanging value, such as money, between parties over blockchain requires digital currency, so JPM Coin allows one client to send money to another over the blockchain instantaneously redeeming the equivalent amount of U.S. dollars.[1]

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?  What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer?
    - At the current ime initial customers are institutions passing J.P. Morgan Know Your Customer (KYC) standards process.[1]
    - While the JPM Coin technology is currently only available to a few business instituations of J.P. Morgan during its testing phase in 2019, Umar Farooq is known to have mentioned in 2018 "the cost-savings and efficiency benefits would extend to the end customers of our instituational clients."[1]  This sample size of J.P. Morgan's experiment contains around 27 million accounts[3] allowing for partners of J.P. Morgan and competitors to find the results of the experiment invaluable.  There are ". . . estimates that global blockchain technology market size will be worth over US$25 billion by 2025."[4]
    - Competitive advantages:
        - Over $2.6 trillion in annual balance sheet assets reported for 2019[5]
        - Company owned "Blockchain Center of Excellence" project leading financial innovation
        - Quorum, J.P. Morgan's blockchain technology

        - Blockchain, facilitates the transfer of payments between institutional clients[6]
        - Quorum, used to run the JPM Coin blockchain technology requiring permissions and users approved by J.P. Morgan[7]

## Landscape

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
    - The primary domain JPM Coin belongs to is Blockchain and cryptocurrancy domain.  "JPM Coin is a digital coin designed to make instantaneous payments using blockchain technology. Exchanging value, such as money, between different parties over a blockchain requires a digital currency, so we created the JPM Coin" says Umar Farooq, head of Digital Treasury Services and Blockchain at J.P. Morgan.[1]

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
    1. Bitcoin, a digital currency experiment
    2. Blockchain, the underlying technology of bitcoin that can be used separately from currency for other needs
    3. "Smart Contracts", Ethereum based second-generation blockchain system allowing for financial systems to be represented in blockchains
    4. "Proof of Stake", allows a person to mine and validate transactions based on the number of coins held
    5. Blockchain Scaling, uses multiple computers to validate transactions and divides the process instead of on one machine.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
    - Recommendation for J.P. Morgan to incorporate its blockchain technology, Quorum, and JPL Coin directly into the consumer market producing a universal dollar-backed currency recognized by banks allowing consumers to use the single currency globally with realtime exchange.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
    - Providing this service to consumers allows for greater ease and increase of opportunities for consumers to capitalize on goods and services globally without the need to exchange currency.  This too allows for a foreseeable decrease in default risk for consumers.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
    - Quorum blockchain
    - JPM Coin
    - RFID chips for tangible products
    - Mobile connectivity
    - "Smart contracts"

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
    - The following technologies allow for the service to be maintained on a single blockchain technology, has a universal form of payment, is scalable, is capable of being used for all goods and services available for purchase, and allows for automation of general ledger transactions putting time back into the hands of consumers.
